## Current Focus
My interest in **Computer Science** has always stood on its own, but recently it has been fueled in large part by my love for **Philosophy**. Philosophy is essentially just pre-science in many respects. Before Newton figured out physics, what he was doing was called **Natural Philosophy**. Right now, the cutting edge of **AI research** is in need of minds that can think outside the box and pioneer new areas of the discipline. One day, I will contribute to that effort. To that effect, I'm diving deep into **machine learning research papers** with a particular interest in **mechanistic interpretability** and **emergent behaviors in neural networks**.

## Background
**Computer Science Student** with a strong foundation in:
- **Software Engineering & System Design**
- **Game Development & Graphics Programming**
- **Full-Stack Web Development**
