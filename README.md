## Current Focus

My interest in Computer Science has always stood on it's own, but recently has been fuelled in a large part, by my love for Philosophy. Philosophy is essentially just pre-science in many respects. Before Newton figured out physics, what he was doing was called Philosophy. Right now, the cutting edge of AI research is in need of minds that can think outside of the box and pioneer new areas of the discipline. One day, I will contribute to that effort. To that effect, I'm diving deep into **machine learning research papers** with a particular interest in mechanistic interpretability and emergent behaviors in neural networks.
